Growth Mindset
A growth mindset is one that does not allow negative thoughts to prevent new learning to occur.  When these negative issues may arise, a growth mindset will reframe the problem into something to be solved rather than hinder any progress to be made.

Three things to ensure a growth mindset are:
1. Level set, level set, level set!  When feeling like one is not as good as everyone else, get an opinion from someone who is more experienced with it to find out where you actually stack up.  Chances are, it is not as bad as you think.
2. Remember the Toyota System.  Nothing is perfect and there is room for growth (improvement) in everything.  When something is thought to have become perfect, start analyzing the process all over again and find the new places for growth.
3. Do not take criticism of work personally.  Sure it can likely be phrased nicer, but the overall content is what matters to help you grow.
