# matplotlib
matplotlib provides a very quick way to visualize 2D-graphics making it the 
single most used Python package for this purpose.

Two other things that are used with matplotlib are:
1. IPython which is an interactive Python shell
2. pyplot which is a convenient interface to use with matplotlib

matplotlib can do each of the following types of plots, most of which are 
more complex than an introductory course to coding can explain.  Here, the 
less common ones are described.
1. Simple (or regular) plot
2. Scatter plot
3. Bar plot
4. Contour plot - used for things like topography and are useful in geology
5. Imshow - shows data as on a 2D regular raster
6. Quiver plot - shows vector lines as arrows and are useful in engineering
7. Pie chart
8. Grid
9. Multiplot - allows multiple plots to be created at the same time
10. Polar axis - shows magnitude vs phase angle and is used for stability 
    analysis
11. 3D plots - used to plot data on three axes attempting to show the 
    relationship between three variables
12. Text

Each of these plots are highly customizable using matplotlibs properties and 
styles that are available.
