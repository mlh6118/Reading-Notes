### Technical Notes for the Non-Technically Inclined
<p>In today's world, there are a plethora of technical solutions to help with one's needs.  The question becomes "What do I need to know?"
<p>Here is some information for you.  This is a short list of topics in this author's view that are important when starting out.
    1. Mac vs Windows PC vs Linux vs Unix
    1. Plain text editor, coding-specific text editors, and IDEs
    1. Terminology

#### Which computer is best?
  <p>If you talk to 20 different people, you will get 20 different answers as to what and why the best computer is such.  It is important to know, however, that in today's world, computers are very similar to one another now.  
  <p>Back in the early-mid 1990s, a Mac was very different from a Windows PC which was again very different from a Linux or Unix computer.  The Mac was well integrated and allowed the users to do many things easily in just a few steps and was a graphical user interface (GUI).  The Windows PC required a number of "moving parts" to make it work and get to what the user desired.  Like the Mac, it was a GUI, but still used DOS (a command line) for a number of things.  A Linux based computer was almost completely command line based and was just beginning to get GUIs made available for it.  Having the experience of working in a campus computer lab in the mid-1990s, I learned that most people that started out on Macs had an easier time going to a Windows PC than the other way around.  Linux and Unix were beasts unto themselves and were best left for the most "nerdy" and "geeky" (labels worn proudly today) at that time.
  <p>Jumping back to today, Macs have a Linux based-OS, Windows are very point-and-click based like the Macs, and Linux has very good GUI options to the point of not needing to use the command line for anything.  Because the computers are so similar, rather than dissimilar, a person should look into the industry they desire to get into and what is most prevalent at the companies they would like to work at just to be able to get used to the same software programs that they would encounter in the future.
    
#### Which editor is best?
<p>The best editor will allow one to grow within it, right along with one's general skill set.  A plain text editor can be useful when one wants to create a very short file with little formatting for output required and save it without all the "bloat" that a larger editing program might cause it to have.  A coding-specific text editor is useful for those wanting to get into programming beyond the basics.  This type of editor will color code different elements of the program being written, along with allowing for extensions to be added for use as one learn more facets of programming.  An IDE is good for those wanting to be in the professional world after they've worked with the coding-specific text editor and one isn't adverse to learning a more complex software package.
    
#### What does that mean?
<p>Regardless of what field you chose to work in and what role, there will be a whole new set of terminology one needs to learn.  In addition, the terminology may change between computers, but the functionality is still very similar.  For example, in Linux, the command "ls" will list the directory's contents, whereas in a Windows shell, the command is "dir".  To learn the terminology, stop the speaker (or whatever is currently being read) and ask what the term means.  
<p>Also try to make an analogy of what the term is thought to be doing and bounce it off of something.  An example of this occurred when I was taking a course in Java earlier in the year.  I was struggling to understand what the terms "get" and "set" were doing and was asked to explain it to my friend who was trying to tutor me.  Eventually, he told me to put my laptop down, just look at him, and tell him what they meant.  I spied a sheet pan drying on a counter and said, "Get means to obtain something and set means to put it down."  In that instance, he finally understood my disconnect and handed me his cell phone asking, "Tell me how to set the temperature on the thermostat."  "I would change the value of the temperature that was desired via the phone."  It was a "eureka" moment because I finally understood what "set" meant and am likely not going to forget it.  If he had simply told me, "Set means to change something," I wouldn't have made the right connections in my brain to retain the information.
<p>The last piece of information about terminology that one needs to know is that it takes time and is not learned overnight.  Remember having to write vocabulary words in elementary school repeatedly?  That was because it is known that repetition is one of the better ways to learn something.  Repetition over a period of days, rather than hours, is even better.

** Often, the most important information is the non-technical information.
