### Technical Notes for the Non-Technically Inclined
<p>In today's world, there are a plethora of technical solutions to help with one's needs.  The question becomes "How do I decide what is right for me as a non-technical person looking to get into it?"
<p>Here is some information to help you get to the best decision for your needs.  Let's start with a brief overview of categories.
    1. Mac vs Windows PC vs Linux vs Unix
    1. Plain text editor, coding-specific text editors, and IDEs
    1. Terminology

#### Which computer is best?
  <p>If you talk to 20 different people, you will get 20 different answers as to what and why the best computer is such.  It is important to know, however, that in today's world, computers are very similar to one another now.  
  <p>Back in the early-mid 1990s, a Mac was very different from a Windows PC which was again very different from a Linux or Unix computer.  The Mac was well integrated and allowed the users to do many things easily in just a few steps and was a graphical user interface (GUI).  The Windows PC required a number of "moving parts" to make it work and get to what the user desired.  Like the Mac, it was a GUI, but still used DOS (a command line) for a number of things.  A Linux based computer was almost completely command line based and was just beginning to get GUIs made available for it.  Having the experience of working in a campus computer lab in the mid-1990s, I learned that most people that started out on Macs had an easier time going to a Windows PC than the other way around.  Linux and Unix were beasts unto themselves and were best left for the most "nerdy" and "geeky" (labels worn proudly today) at that time.
  <p>Jumping back to today, Macs have a Linux based-OS, Windows are very point-and-click based like the Macs, and Linux has very good GUI options to the point of not needing to use the command line for anything.  Because the computers are so similar, rather than dissimilar, a person should look into the industry they desire to get into and what is most prevalent at the companies they would like to work at just to be able to get used to the same software programs that they would encounter in the future.
