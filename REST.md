# REST  
### REST Explained  
1. Who is Roy Fielding?  
Someone that helped write the first web servers, specifically HTTP.

2. Why don't the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?  
All machines need to talk about all the stuff on all the other machines, so having a way to for one machine to tell another machine about a resource on a third machine is needed.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?  
HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol which is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.  [HTTP/1.1](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html)

4. What does a `GET` do?  
A `GET` retrieves a web page.

5. What does a `POST` do?  
A `POST` adds something to another system.

6. What does a `PUT` do?  
A `PUT` replaces something in another system.

7. What does `PATCH` do?
