## Learning Markdown for GitHub

<p>Markdown sounds like a something you would encounter from a teacher grading someone's assignment.  It is, in fact, just another term for a simple way to change text styles on on pages within GitHub.

<p>Here are things, but not a complete listing, that are encountered when using markdown:
* Headings
* Emphasis (e.g., *italics* and **bold**)
* Lists (This is an unordered example)
* Links
* Code (inline and syntax highlighted)

<p>When you are just starting out, it is a good idea to grab a "cheat sheet" of the different markdown options.  There are many available online ready for you to use.
