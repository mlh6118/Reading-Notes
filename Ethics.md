# Ethics in the Workplace and Technology
## Ethics in the Workplace - [Microsoft and DOD](https://web.archive.org/web/20200616232735/https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-employees-protest-contract-us-army-hololens-2019-2)
This article discussed how Microsoft employees were upset that the product(s)
that they worked on were now being developed under contract for the 
Department of Defense (DoD) without their having any say in whether it 
should be because they didn't want to be part of "war profiteering" and 
creating something that had more "lethality".  I see both sides of the issue.
On the one hand, they didn't originally set out to create something that 
would be part of the DoD, unlike say an aerospace manufacturer that develops 
military aircraft, nor did they join a company known for pursuing DoD 
contracts that would have given a signal that this might be something that 
would come up.  Yet, the article did say that the employees were given a 
chance to comment on the issue a significant time prior to the contract 
being obtained.  (DoD contracts typically take years to develop, submit, and 
get awarded.)  On the other hand, many of our technologies have come from 
military development, plus these technologies are to save our military from 
deadly conflicts by "replacing" them in the field.  If just one child is 
saved from having a parent lost in a conflict on a battlefield due to these 
new technologies, then I believe it is completely worth it.

## Ethics in Technology - [Will Democracy Survive Big Data and AI](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-democracy-survive-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence/)
When I started reading this article, it struck me as odd that the AI that 
tailors ads to people doesn't know my friends well enough.  They will post 
on social media how they are getting ads for something that they don't have 
any interest in and don't understand how the AI thinks they do.  In fact, I 
was laughing at it.  

As I read farther in the article, it started talking about politics and 
divisions among groups that AI had started creating wedges in and where it 
was going to take society.  I decided to look at the date and found it was 
written in 2016.  What has happened in the 6 years since the article shows 
how prescient the authors were based on what they were seeing.  This article 
was a harbinger of things to come that not enough people paid attention to, 
and society is paying a serious price since people are not able to 
compromise with others, be they politicians or others.  Sadly, the 
exploitation of tailoring social media and ads to people has divided our 
society, perhaps irrevocably.
