# Linked Lists
## What is a linked list?
A sequence of nodes that are connected to each other where each node 
references the next node.

Two types of linked lists: singly and doubly
* These refer to the number of references a node has.

Linked lists cannot be traversed using a foreach or for loop.  A while loop 
can be used for traversing the linked list with Next property being used t5o 
ensure the next node in the list is not null.

Linked lists are linear data structures, meaning there is a sequence and an 
order to how they are constructed and traversed.

Linked lists are dynamic data structures.

A single node has two parts: data and a reference to the next node.

A doubly linked list has two references within each node: a reference to the 
next node, and one to the previous node.

Linked lists are usually efficient for adding and removing elements, but 
slow to search and find a single element.
