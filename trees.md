## Trees - A Family Reunion
k-ary: Hey everyone.  How are you doing?  
Binary Depth First (BDF): Doing fine, but who are you?  
k-ary: I'm k-ary.  I'm a distant cousin of yours.  If I remember what I 
heard about you correctly, you have a max of two nodes off of each root.  
BDF: Yes, that's correct.  You don't?  
k-ary: No, I can have as many nodes off of each root as desired.  
Binary Breadth First (BBF): Wow, you really are a distant cousin, aren't you?
k-ary: Yes, but we're still related.  
BBF: How do you get traversed?  I get traversed by starting at the root, 
then going down one level and getting all children from that level before 
moving to the next one down.  
k-ary: I can be traversed in the same way.  However, I can also be traversed 
in a depth first manner.  
BBF: What's depth first?  
BDF: I'm depth first, silly!  You know, I start at the root, then go down 
and get the children for a single node on one side, then go down and get the 
children for a single node on one side again before going back up to the root 
and going down to get the other side's children.  
BBF: Really?  You can do either type of traversal k-ary?  
k-ary: That's right.  
BBF: What about your Big Os?  Mine for space is O(w) where w is the greatest 
width of a level.  
BDF: And mine is O(n), but only because I lack organizational skills 
(structure).  
k-ary: Mine are the same as both of yours depending on how I am handling 
adding new nodes or searching.  
BDF: Hey BST.  This is our distant cousin, k-ary.  k-ary, this is Binary 
Search Tree.  We refer to it as BST.  We were just talking about our Big Os.
BST: My time Big O is O(h) where h is the height.  What's yours?
k-ary: Mine is the same as all of yours depending on what I am being used for.  
BST: Oh.  Well, my Big O of space is O(1) because I don't allocate any 
additional space during the search.  Can you do that?  
k-ary: No, mine is more like BBF's and BDF's.  Oh, looks like a child is 
calling for me.  I better go take care of them.  Nice meeting you.  
BBF: By k-ary.  Thanks for the chat.
