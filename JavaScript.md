### The Language Basics
Variables:
- identified with unique names
  - names can containe letters, digits, underscores (_), and dollar signs ($)
  - names must begin with letter, $, or _
  - names are case sensitive
  - reserved words cannot be used as names
<p>- To declare:
  - undefined variable
  `var paintColor;`
  or
  - defined variable
  `var paintColor = "Turqoise";`</p>
- Best practice is to declare all variables at start of script
- Can put multiple variables on a single line, just need to separate with a comma (,)
- re-declaring does not clear the variable value
Assignment Operator:
- a single equal sign (=)
- tells the computer to put the value after the equal sign into the variable before the equal sign
Data Types:
- numbers
- text strings
- many others
