# React and Components
## Components  
### What is a "component"?  
"A **component** is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reuseable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implmentation and exporting it a higher-level interface." - [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

Written more succinctly, W3 Schools states that "Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML." - [React Components](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_components.asp)

### What are the characteristics of a component?  
- Reusability: Can be used in different situations for different applications.
- Replaceable: Can be substituted with other similar components.
- Not context specific: Designed to operate in environments and contexts.
- Extensible: Can be extended from existing components to provide new behaviors.
- Encapsulated - Deptics interfaces allowing use of functionality without exposing internal processes, variables, or states.
- Independent: Minimal dependencies on other components.

### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?  
- Ease of deployment
- Reduced cost
- Ease of development
- Reusable
- Modification of technical complexity
- Reliability
- System maintenance and evolution
- Independent

## Props
### What is "props" short for?  
"Props" is a keyword in React which stands for "properties" and is used for passing data from one component to another.

### How are props used in React?  
Props are used for passing data from one component to another.

### What is the flow of props?  
The flow of props is uni-drectional from the parent to the child.
