# Process of Website Design

Before beginning to generate a website, one needs to go through the design process.  There are specific questions to ask oneself and answer:
- Who is the site for?  
  - Individuals?
  - Companies?
  - Both?
- Why are people going to visit the site?  
  - What are key motivations?  
  - What specific goals do they have?
- What are visitors trying to achieve?  
  - What info do they need?  
  - How often will they visit the site?

Once these questions are answered, a site map can be generated and card sorting to determine how the components of the website should be put together.

Following the site map generation, create a simple sketch of key info on each page called a wireframe.  These should not include anything that contains things like font, color schemes, and other "decorative" things.

Next should be organizing and prioritizing the various parts of the site map to help a visitor know how to read the page.  Because most users skim a page, there is a visual hierarchy requirement which refers to the order eyes perceive what they see.  Visual contrast is a key feature with a well-designed page being largely subliminal.  An element's size, color, and style all contribute to the visual hierarchy.  Grouping elements also makes a design easier to comprehend.

It is only after consideration of all of the above that any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be started.
