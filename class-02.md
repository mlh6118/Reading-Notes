# Process of Website Design

<p>Before beginning to generate a website, one needs to go through the design process.  There are specific questions to ask oneself and answer:
<ul>
  <li>Who is the site for?  Individuals?  Companies?  Both?</li>
  <li>Why are people going to visit the site?  What are key motivations?  What specific goals do they have?</li>
  <li>What are visitors trying to achieve?  What info do they need?  How often will they visit the site?</li>
</ul>

Once these questions are answered, a site map can be generated and card sorting to determine how the components of the website should be put together.<p>

<p>Following the site map generation, create a simple sketch of key info on each page called a wireframe.  These should not include anything that contains things like font, color schemes, and other "decorative" things.</p>

<p>Next should be organizing and prioritizing the various parts of the site map to help a visitor know how to read the page.  Because most users skim a page, there is a visual hierarchy requirement which refers to the order eyes perceive what they see.  Visual contrast is a key feature with a well-designed page being largely subliminal.  An element's size, color, and style all contribute to the visual hierarchy.  Grouping elements also makes a design easier to comprehend.</p>

<p>It is only after consideration of all of the above that any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be started.</p>

## Basics of HTML, CSS, and JS

**HTML**

<p>HTML is used for setting up the content of a webpage.  There are two types of markups that make up HTML: structural and semantic.</p>

<p>Structural markup are the elements for headings and paragraphs.</p>

<p>Semantic markup provides extra info for the content, such as what should be emphasized in a sentence.</p>

<p>There are many different elements that can be used within HTML, but some common ones are:
<ul>
  <li>`<h#>`: 1 is the main heading of a page, 2 is a subheading, 3 is a subheading of 2, and so on.</li>
  <li>`<p>`: Denotes paragraphs and browsers default to putting space between each paragraph.</li>
  <li>`<b>` and `<i>`: Bold and italics.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>It is important to note that browsers all treat white space the same: As a single space.  This means that two or more spaces, line breaks, etc., are collapsed into a single space when rendered on the screen.</p>
