# React and Forms

### React Docs - Forms   
1. What is a 'Controlled Component'?
A 'controlled component' is an input form element whose value is controlled by React.

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them?  Why?   
The state should be updated with a user's response as soon as it is entered because the data is then readily available for other functions within the code to use it.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?   
We target what the user is entering if we have an event handler or an input field by adding a `name` attribute to the element.

### Ternary Operators
1. Why would we use a ternary operator?   
For a simple if conditional with simple results, a ternary operator is an easy to read, one-line statement.

2. x === y ? true : false;
