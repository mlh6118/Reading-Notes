### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming  
1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?  
* Greater efficiency
* Engaged collaboration
* Learning from fellow students
* Social skills
* Job interview readiness
* Work environment readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?  
I find that learning from fellow students is the most beneificial for me.  I appreciate being able to ask immediately if I am confused by something and getting a response to clear it up, as opposed to trying to read something or having to wait a long time for an answer.

3. How does pair programming work?  
Pair programming works by having one person be the "driver" who does all of the typing and one person being the "navigator" who talks out what the code should be.  Ideally, the driver and navigator positions should be switched off to allow both people to take in new ideas of how to accomplish the task required by the program.
