# Probability in Python

The usefulness of probablity is limitless.  As a student in manufacturing 
engineering, one of my professors explained to the class that companies now 
created warranties to expire shortly before the product would break.  This 
was all based on probabilities and came about due to companies realizing 
they were losing money by having products that lasted.

Probability tries to answer what the chance of an event happening is.  There 
are two key terms in probability:
* even: outcome of interest
* sample space: the set of all possible events that can happen

##### Central Limit Theorem: The distribution of estimates will look like a normal distribution.
##### Three Sigma Rule: Expression of how many observations fall within a certain distance of the mean.
* Given a normal distribution:
  * 68% will fall within one standard deviation.
  * 95% will fall within two standard deviations.
  * 99.7 will fall within three standard deviations.

* Rarity of extreme values: any value more than three standard deviations 
  away from the mean should be treated with caution or care.

##### Calculating the Z-score
z = (&chi;<sub>i</sub> - &mu;) / &sigma;
